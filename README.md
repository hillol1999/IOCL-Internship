## Employee Satisfaction Analysis and Predictive Modelling at Indian Oil Corporation Limited

### Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting employee satisfaction at Indian Oil Corporation Limited, using a blend of data analytics and machine learning techniques. Data collected through a survey of 53 employees across 11 departments was analyzed to understand job satisfaction and engagement levels, identify key factors influencing satisfaction, and build predictive models for future insights.

### Key Objectives:
- **Assess Employee Satisfaction:** Gauge satisfaction levels across various departments and job levels.
- **Identify Key Factors:** Analyze which factors, such as compensation, engagement, and recognition, most influence employee satisfaction.
- **Predictive Modelling:** Develop machine learning models to predict employee job satisfaction based on a range of factors.
  
### Data:
- **Sample Size:** 53 employees (6.5% of the total workforce)
- **Departments Surveyed:** 11 departments, including Civil, Finance, HR, IT, and others.
- **Job Levels:** Entry, executive, mid-level, and senior-level positions.

### Tools & Technologies Used:
- **Data Analysis:** Microsoft Excel for data cleaning, SQL Server for querying and deeper analysis, Power BI for visual insights, and Python for machine learning.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Simple Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests were employed to predict job satisfaction and identify influential factors.
  
### Key Insights:
- **Satisfaction Levels:** On a 5-point Likert scale, employees in IT had the highest satisfaction score (5/5), with the rest averaging a satisfaction score of 4/5.
- **Performance Appraisal:** 85% of respondents felt the performance appraisal system was fair.
- **Training:** 98.1% of employees participated in training programs within the past five years.
- **Job Satisfaction and Compensation Correlation:** A moderate positive correlation (0.4043) was observed between job satisfaction and compensation.
- **Predictive Models:** Logistic regression achieved perfect accuracy in predicting job satisfaction, while Random Forest analysis revealed compensation, work engagement, and recognition as the most significant factors driving satisfaction.

### Visualizations:
The project includes rich visual insights developed using Power BI to represent correlations between job satisfaction, compensation, recognition rewards, job security, and engagement levels.

### Conclusion:
This project showcases how data analytics and machine learning can be leveraged to provide actionable insights into employee satisfaction. The findings offer valuable guidance for improving organizational strategies related to compensation, recognition, and employee engagement, ultimately fostering a more satisfied and motivated workforce.
